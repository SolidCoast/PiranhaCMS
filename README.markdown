Welcome to PiranhaCMS
=====================
This is the base template for building a Piranha web application. It creates an
empty project with an unistalled SqlCompact database. As the core framwork is still
under development for the initial version the functionality is still somewhat 
limited.

To get started, download the latest snapshop of the repository as a zip-file and
unpack it on your harddrive. Then create an IIS-application with .NET 4.0 pointing
to your new Piranha folder. To install the database navigate to your new applicaiton
in your browser of choice.

Once the application database is installed you're good to go. Please post issues,
requests or other suggestions in the main repository for the framework.

May the force be with you.
